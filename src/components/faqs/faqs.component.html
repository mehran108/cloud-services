          <p>
            DevOps is a combination of tools and practices that increases an
            organization’s ability to deliver products and services at a faster
            pace without compromising the quality of the software. The speed
            allows organizations to better compete in the market and enhance
            customer experience. It also allows businesses more time for
            innovating as the processes get streamlined and employee efficiency is
            improved.
